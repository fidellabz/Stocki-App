# Project Frontend Development Guidelines

Welcome to our frontend development team! Before you start working on any tasks, please make sure to follow the guidelines outlined below. These guidelines are designed to maintain a consistent and organized codebase, facilitate collaboration, and ensure the quality of our frontend code.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   - Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/kodecampteam/bg-group2-frontend.git
     ```
2. **Switch to the develop Branch:**
   - Go to the folder where the clone repo is:
     ```
     cd bg-group2-frontend/
     ```
   - Switch to the Develop branch to get the code structure and to avoid pushing to the main branch:
     ```
     git checkout develop
     ```

3. **Development workflow:**

**Please Note:**
- Never push directly to the main branch.
- Only merge your branch into the develop branch after receiving approval from the team lead and completing the code review process.
- You can start working on the tasks you're assigned to from the develop branch
- When you're done and wants to push, please ensure to create your own branch before your push

   **Follow these steps:**
  ```
   git checkout -B <name of your branch>                 /* creates your new branch and switch to it */
   ```
   ```
   git add .                                           /* add your code to the your branch */
   ```
  ```
  git commit -m 'first commit'                        /* commit to your branch */
   ```
   ```
   git push -u origin <name of the branch you created> /* push to your branch */
   ```

## Communication

1. **Reporting Issues:**
   - If you encounter any issues with a feature or have questions, alert the team lead immediately. We'll work together to resolve any problems.

2. **Collaboration:**
   - Foster open communication within the team. Share your progress, ask for feedback, and help your teammates when needed.

## Project Structure

1. **Directory Structure:**
   - Follow the established project structure to keep our codebase organized.
   - Ensure that your code adheres to the structure outlined in the project documentation.

2. **Code Comments:**
   - Comment your code to make it more readable and understandable.
   - Use clear and concise comments to explain complex sections or important functionality.
