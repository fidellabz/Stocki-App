                        Stocki offers a productivity app (i.e., a desktop version or a browser supported
                        computer program or smartphone application) (the “App”) branded as “Stocki” (with one or more variations) that helps users remember the location of our end users’ things at home, at work, in storage, or during move or travel (collectively, the “Service”). The App is currently available for download through Apple’s App Store and Google’s
                         Play Store (each, the “Store”).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These Terms of Service (these “Terms”) govern your use of the Stocki website, 
                        www.stocki.com (the “Website”), the App and the Service, which are owned, run, operated and
                         managed by Stocki Inc., a Nigerian corporation (“Stocki,” “we,” “us,” or “our”). 
                         If you entered into a separately executed order form issued pursuant to these Terms (“Order Form”), that Order Form is incorporated by reference into these Terms unless explicitly stated otherwise. In the event of a conflict between these Terms and any terms and conditions
                         contained within an incorporated Order Form, the Order Form governs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        THESE TERMS ARE A LEGALLY BINDING CONTRACT BETWEEN YOU AND STOCKI, SO PLEASE 
                        READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY. BY ACCESSING OR USING THE WEBSITE OR OUR SERVICE,
                         YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS AND ALL POLICIES, GUIDELINES, AND ORDER FORMS
                          INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE HEREIN. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS
                           SET FORTH IN THESE TERMS, YOU MAY NOT USE THE WEBSITE OR THE SERVICE. 
                        WE SUGGEST YOU PRINT A COPY OF THESE TERMS FOR YOUR RECORDS.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        
                        If you are using the Website or the Service on behalf of any organization, 
                        you represent and warrant that you are authorized to accept these Terms on 
                        such organization’s behalf (in which case, “you” and “your,” will refer to that 
                         organization), and that such organization agrees to indemnify you and us for violations of these Terms.
                         Nothing in these Terms will be deemed to confer rights or benefits on any third party.  
                    </p>
